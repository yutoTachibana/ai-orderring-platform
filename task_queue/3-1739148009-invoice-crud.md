## Description

Implement CRUD for invoices: list (filter by contract/status/period), create (from contract + working hours), read, update status. Auto-calculate amount from unit price × working hours. Status transitions: draft→sent→paid→overdue. Include monthly aggregation endpoint. Pydantic schemas, service layer, pytest tests.
