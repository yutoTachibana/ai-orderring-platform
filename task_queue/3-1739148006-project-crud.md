## Description

Implement CRUD for projects: list (filter by status/required_skills/budget_range/company), create, read, update, delete. Include required skills (many-to-many with SkillTag), budget range (min/max JPY), project period (start/end date), headcount, status transitions as defined in CLAUDE.md (draft→open→in_progress→completed→closed). Pydantic schemas, service layer, pytest tests.
