## Description

Create mcp-servers/server_b/ - Same structure as server_a but for Web System B. Different page objects reflecting System B's UI. Same base class, same interface. Dockerfile. Tests. The key difference is the page_objects/ implementation for System B's specific form layout and navigation flow.
